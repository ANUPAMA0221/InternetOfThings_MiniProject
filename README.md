The novel Coronavirus has arrived in a new way of life in which social isolation and the use of face masks are crucial in restricting the virus's spread. However, most people do not wear face masks in public areas, allowing infections to spread more easily. This could lead to a significant situation with increased spread. To avoid such scenarios, we must inspect and educate individuals on the use of face masks. Because of the risk of being harmed by corona, humans cannot participate in this process. As a result, artificial intelligence (AI), which is the central focus of our study, is required. Our project involves the identification of persons wearing face masks and not wearing face masks in public places by means of image processing and AI techniques and checking the temperature of the person by sensors and sending alert messages to authority persons. The object detection algorithms are used for identification of persons with and without wearing face masks which also gives the count of persons wearing mask and not wearing face mask and Internet Of Things (IOT) is utilized for sending alert messages. The alert messages are sent to the authority persons through mobile notification.
